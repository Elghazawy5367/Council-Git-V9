# Code Mirror Prompt Template for Google AI Studio

## Context
I'm building The Council (market intelligence tool) using TypeScript on a Samsung tablet.
Tech stack: React + Vite + TypeScript + TanStack Query

## My Current Code:
```typescript
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]
```

## Professional Reference:
I want to upgrade this to match the quality of [REPO_NAME].

## Task:
1. **Gap Analysis**: Compare my code to professional patterns
   - What error handling am I missing?
   - What type safety improvements needed?
   - What performance optimizations overlooked?

2. **The Upgrade**: Rewrite my code to incorporate these patterns
   - Keep it simple for junior developer
   - Use strict TypeScript
   - Add inline comments explaining the "why"

3. **The Win**: Explain in one sentence what this upgrade achieves

## Constraints:
- Runs on GitHub Actions (not local)
- Low bandwidth (use caching)
- Must handle API failures gracefully
