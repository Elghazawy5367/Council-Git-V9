@workspace Implement the Google Studio integration as unlimited AI fallback:

THE PROBLEM:
- Project IDX has message limits that block development
- Need unlimited AI assistance for code generation

THE SOLUTION:
Create a prompt template system that uses Google AI Studio when IDX hits limits.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create docs/prompts/MIRROR_PROMPT.md:
````markdown
# Code Mirror Prompt Template for Google AI Studio

## Context
I'm building The Council (market intelligence tool) using TypeScript on a Samsung tablet.
Tech stack: React + Vite + TypeScript + TanStack Query

## My Current Code:
```typescript
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]
```

## Professional Reference:
I want to upgrade this to match the quality of [REPO_NAME].

## Task:
1. **Gap Analysis**: Compare my code to professional patterns
   - What error handling am I missing?
   - What type safety improvements needed?
   - What performance optimizations overlooked?

2. **The Upgrade**: Rewrite my code to incorporate these patterns
   - Keep it simple for junior developer
   - Use strict TypeScript
   - Add inline comments explaining the "why"

3. **The Win**: Explain in one sentence what this upgrade achieves

## Constraints:
- Runs on GitHub Actions (not local)
- Low bandwidth (use caching)
- Must handle API failures gracefully

2. Create docs/prompts/FEATURE_REQUEST.md:
````markdown
# Feature Request Template for Google AI Studio

## What I Need:
[Describe feature in plain English]

## Current Code Structure:
- Main file: src/lib/[filename].ts
- Related components: src/components/[...].tsx
- Current approach: [brief description]

## Requirements:
- Must work on Samsung tablet
- Must use existing cache system
- Must follow TypeScript strict mode
- Must handle errors gracefully

## Example Output:
[Show what the feature should produce]

## Integration Points:
- Where it plugs into existing code
- What data it needs
- What data it produces
````

3. Create docs/GOOGLE_STUDIO_WORKFLOW.md:
````markdown
# When to Use Google Studio vs IDX

## Use IDX AI for:
- Quick syntax fixes
- Refactoring existing code
- Debugging errors
- Simple questions

## Use Google Studio for:
- Implementing new features (>100 lines)
- Architectural decisions
- Complex algorithm design
- When IDX says "message limit reached"

## Workflow:
1. Hit IDX limit → Copy prompt template
2. Open ai.google.dev/aistudio
3. Paste template + your code
4. Get unlimited responses
5. Copy solution back to IDX
6. Test and iterate
````

WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:
- IDX limits = your biggest bottleneck
- Google Studio = unlimited (free tier generous)
- Enables continuous development despite limits
- Professional quality code generation

OUTPUT:
- 3 reusable prompt templates
- Clear decision tree: IDX vs Google Studio
- Workflow documentation
