    overview:
      title: "Neurodivergent Adults - ADHD, Autism, Executive Function Support"
      description: |
        Adults with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and other neurodivergent conditions seeking 
        practical tools for executive function, time management, organization, sensory regulation, 
        communication, and daily life management. Underserved market with high willingness to pay 
        for solutions that actually work for non-neurotypical brains. Growing self-diagnosis and 
        late-diagnosis trend creating demand for adult-focused resources.
      pain_score: 91
      opportunity_score: 88
      solo_founder_fit: 95
      estimated_market_size: "15-20% of global population (1B+), growing awareness"
      growth_trend: "rapidly growing"
      
    pain_points:
      primary: "Neurotypical productivity systems don't work - traditional planners, to-do lists, and time management methods fail for neurodivergent brains, causing shame and burnout"
      secondary: "Executive function struggles - task initiation, time blindness, working memory issues, decision paralysis, and emotional regulation challenges"
      tertiary: "Lack of neurodivergent-specific resources - most tools/templates assume neurotypical processing, no accommodations for sensory needs, dopamine-seeking behavior, or rejection sensitivity"

# Notes
# =============================================================================
notes: |
  Selection Criteria Used:
  - All niches have 92+ Solo-Founder Fit scores
  - All are NON-TECHNICAL (templates, reports, guides, coaching)
  - All have multiple revenue models
  - All have fast path to first dollar (7-14 days)
  - All have clear, validated pain points
  - Strategic breadth: Multiple pain points per niche allow data-driven focus
  
  Neurodivergent Niche Rationale (replaces Maritime):
  - Massive underserved market (15-20% of population)
  - Pain Score: 91/100 (neurotypical tools consistently fail)
  - High willingness to pay for solutions that actually work
  - Growing self-diagnosis/late-diagnosis trend (especially ADHD/autism in adults)
  - Strong online community with active discussion and support
  - Non-technical deliverables: templates, planners, guides, checklists, workbooks
  - Fast to first revenue: digital products can launch in 7 days
  - Multiple revenue models: $9-$497 range from digital downloads to coaching
  - Clear pain points: executive function, time blindness, sensory needs, communication
  
  Next Steps:
  1. All 13 features operational and generating reports
  2. Quality Pipeline filtering to top 20 items daily
  3. Market Gap Identifier identifying Blue Oceans weekly
  4. Council recommends highest-scoring opportunity
  5. Build validated product with 70-80% success rate
