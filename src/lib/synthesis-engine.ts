**Step 1: Extraction**
First, extract the core claims from each expert:
${expertOutputs
    .map((e, i) => `- Expert ${i + 1} (${e.name}) claims: [extract 3-5 key points]`)
    .join("\n")}

**Step 2: Clustering**
Now, group similar claims across experts:
- Cluster A (topic): Mentioned by [which experts] saying [what]
- Cluster B (topic): Mentioned by [which experts] saying [what]
- Unique claims: [which expert said what unique thing]

**Step 3: Conflict Detection**
Identify where experts contradict each other:
- Conflict 1: [Expert X says A, Expert Y says opposite/different B]
- Reasoning: [Why is this a genuine conflict vs just different framing?]

**Step 4: Resolution**
For each conflict:
- Evaluate evidence: [Which side has stronger support?]
- Context matters: [Can both be true in different scenarios?]
- Synthesized view: [What's the integrated position?]

**Step 5: Final Synthesis**
Based on the reasoning above:

## AREAS OF AGREEMENT
• [Consensus point] - supported by {Expert names}
  Evidence: [why they agree]

## UNIQUE VALUABLE INSIGHTS
• From {Expert}: [insight]
  Why it matters: [value of this unique perspective]

## CONFLICTS RESOLVED
• Issue: [what they disagreed on]
• Positions:
  - {Expert 1}: [position and reasoning]
  - {Expert 2}: [position and reasoning]
• Resolution: [synthesized position that preserves truth from both]
  Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]

## INTEGRATED RECOMMENDATION
[2-3 paragraphs synthesizing everything into clear, actionable advice with specific steps]`;

**Branch 1: Consensus-First Interpretation**
Hypothesis: Experts fundamentally agree, with minor stylistic differences.
Analysis:
- What are the core overlapping points? [list]
- How strong is the agreement? [evaluate evidence]
- What's the unified narrative? [synthesis]
Score this interpretation: [0.0-1.0 likelihood this framing is accurate]

**Branch 2: Conflict-First Interpretation**
Hypothesis: Experts have fundamental disagreements that matter.
Analysis:
- What are the major points of conflict? [list]
- Are these resolvable or genuine trade-offs? [evaluate]
- If unresolvable, what does that mean? [implications]
Score this interpretation: [0.0-1.0 likelihood this framing is accurate]

**Branch 3: Complementary Interpretation**
Hypothesis: Experts address different dimensions (not conflicting, just orthogonal).
Analysis:
- What dimension does each expert focus on? [time/risk/cost/technical/strategic]
- Can all views coexist as complementary? [evaluate]
- How do they fit together? [integration]
Score this interpretation: [0.0-1.0 likelihood this framing is accurate]

**Path Selection**
Based on evidence and scores, the most accurate framing is: **Branch X**
Reasoning: [explain why this interpretation best fits the data]

**SYNTHESIS USING SELECTED PATH:**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[2-3 sentences capturing the essence based on best-path framing]
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]

## KEY FINDINGS
[Organized according to the selected interpretive path]
- Finding 1: [supported by which experts and why]
- Finding 2: [supported by which experts and why]
- Finding 3: [supported by which experts and why]

## RESOLVED DISAGREEMENTS
[Using the logic from the selected path]
- Disagreement 1:
  - Positions: [what each expert said]
  - Resolution: [how the selected path resolves this]
  - Supporting logic: [evidence-based reasoning]

## UNIQUE INSIGHTS WORTH NOTING
[Individual expert contributions that add unique value]
- From {Expert}: [insight]
  Value: [why this is important to preserve]

## INTEGRATED RECOMMENDATION

**Immediate Actions (0-1 month):**
• [Action 1 based on consensus]
• [Action 2 based on consensus]

**Medium-Term Strategy (1-6 months):**
• [Action based on complementary views]
• [Action based on resolved conflicts]

**Long-Term Considerations (6+ months):**
• [Strategic direction]

**Risks to Monitor:**
• [Risk 1 from unresolved tensions]
• [Risk 2 from expert caveats]

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

**High Confidence (>80%):**
- [Aspects where all experts agreed with strong evidence]

**Medium Confidence (50-80%):**
- [Aspects with some disagreement but reasonable synthesis]

**Low Confidence (<50%):**
- [Aspects requiring more information or context]
- Recommendation: [what additional info would help]`;
